# Towards the Watermarking of Large Language Models: A Survey
This thesis, developed as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bologna, focused on employing watermarking techniques to protect the intellectual property of LLMs and of text documents on which LLMs could be trained unjustly.\
The work starts with a comprehensive review of LLMs and text watermarking techniques. Building on this foundation, it proposes a novel approach to the authorship attribution problem for LLMs, consisting of an LLM architecture designed not only to determine whether a given text was produced by an LLM, but also to identify the specific model responsible for its generation. Furthermore, a probable solution has been given to determine whether a text document has been used to train an LLM.\
The work aimed to advance ongoing research in the field, providing new insights and potential applications in areas such as authenticity verification, intellectual property protection, and responsible AI usage.
