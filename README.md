# Towards the Watermarking of Large Language Models: A Survey
This thesis, developed as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bologna, reviewed the state of the art in large language models (LLMs) and existing watermarking methods, highlighting current challenges in the detection of AI-generated text. Building on this foundation, it proposed a novel approach consisting of an LLM architecture designed not only to determine whether a given text was produced by an LLM, but also to identify the specific model responsible for its generation. Furthermore, a probable solution has been given to determine whether a text document has been used to train an LLM.\
By extending beyond simple detection to model attribution, the work aimed to advance ongoing research in the field, providing new insights and potential applications in areas such as authenticity verification, intellectual property protection, and responsible AI usage.
