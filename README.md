# thesis-WatermarkingLLMs
This thesis reviewed the state of the art in large language models (LLMs) and existing watermarking methods. Building on this foundation, it proposed a novel approach designed not only to determine whether a given text was produced by an LLM, but also to identify the specific model responsible for its generation.
